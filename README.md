Task Force for COA

I have uploaded my entry for the COA TASKFORCE Challenge to this repository. 
The task is utilizing JavaScript to solve two code challenges and create an interactive photo gallery.

Setting Up an Interactive Photo Gallery: A Guide
Make a local copy of the repository on your computer: git clone< https://github.com/FaustinNiyomurengezi2580/Faustin_Interactive_Photo_Gallery_Workdone

Go into the project directory: Interactive picture gallery on CD To view the interactive photo gallery, open the index.html file in your web browser.
To view the interactive gallery's layout, position, and everything, open the index.js file.

How to Approach HTML Structure I created the HTML framework for the picture gallery using the Figma drawings that were supplied.
Every picture is wrapped in an element with the proper style and interaction classes applied.
and i have applied CSS Styling: To ensure pixel-perfect correctness, I styled the gallery components using CSS
with the Figma designs Media queries were implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript Interactivity: According to the Figma prototype, additional information is shown when a user hovers over a photo. 
JavaScript was utilized to develop interactivity elements including image navigation and hover interactions.


Setting Up Coding Challenges: A Guide Go to the directory of challenges:
CD challenges oneself To see the solutions, open the stringTransform.js and arrayMap.js files in your favorite code editor.
Method for Manipulating Arrays (arrayMap.js): I created a method to ascertain whether an array contains a continuous subarray that adds up to the desired amount. 
The solution achieves the anticipated time and space complexity by adhering to the given problem statement and constraints.


String Transformation (stringTransform.js): Using the guidelines given, I created a function that modifies strings. 
All potential scenarios listed in the solution are addressed in
